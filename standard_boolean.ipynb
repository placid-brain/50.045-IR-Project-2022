Slowly pour in the curds and whey. The whey will drain off; discard it or, if you are feeling ambitious, you can use it to make ricotta or as a substitute for water or milk when you are baking.', 'Leave the curds, covered and refrigerated, to continue draining and solidifying for another 24 hours or so before using.', 'Fresh homemade cream cheese lasts about 1 week in the refrigerator.', '~NOTE~ Central Market and Whole Foods both carry tablets of rennet, an enzyme that makes milk coagulate.']\n",
